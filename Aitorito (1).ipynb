There are many questions that must be addressed in the debate, like: Which culture brings higher economic development? Which one leads to higher inequality within the individuals of a society? Which one is more population growth enhancing? Is any of both a dominant strategy for the survival of individuals? Is one of them more efficient than the other in allocating resources among the population? \n",

    "Aiming to answer some of the questions above, we are going to run some simulations of a game that we have specially designed to tackle the topic in question and analyze the results gathered to enable a later discussion.\n",
    "The main research questions we have tried to address in this project are the following:\n",
    "  \n",
    "Do societies tend to cluster into communities?\n",
    "    \n",
    "Do societies with a high concentration of individuals in a community in the first period lead to a higher population size by allocating better the resources? Which are the differences of this possible effect in the short and the long run?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there a steady state? Is it unique for each endowment?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial hypotheses was that societies will tend to cluster into communities over time. The reason for that is that all individuals could end up in a situation were they have no food in a certain period. Thus, even in the case where individuals have high capabilities/ability to gather resources, they could end up in having no resources. In that case, they would only survive if they belong to a community where other individuals can share exceeding food with them. \n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us directly to our second hypothesis (which refers to the second research question). We have hypothesized that socities where there is a community with a large share of individuals in the first period is going to enhance a higher population size due to such reallocation of resources. Individuals that are part of a large community will have better chances to absorve a higher share of the total food and consequently, to have higher chances to survive. Thus, we expect that in the short run, societies with a larger community are going to experiment higher chances to survive, ergo, a higher population size. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the long run, we expect that population size is going to reach a kind of steady state (maximum population size) independently from the initial endowment of individuals concentration in a large community. This is the hypothesis that we expect to answer our third research question."

    "We have ploted two different graphs showing relevant information that is going to help us to answer our research questions. \n",
    "'Graph 1' shows how the concentration of individuals in the largest community evolves over time. With this graph, we are going to be able to provide an answer to our first research question (Do societies tend to cluster into communities?). As it is shown in the graph, concentration in the largest community grows from close to 45% to almost 85% in the early periods after the initial endowment. It means that in a few periods, individuals of a society tend to concentrate in the largest community exogenously determined in the first period. Therefore, we may be in front of the answer to our first research quation, were societies actually tend to cluster into communities instead of dissolve and living on their own or forming different communities of a similar size. Once societies have reached values around 85% of concentration of individuals in the largest community, they remain close to 85%. We can therefore conclude that societies tend to cluster into communities over time, and, additionally, we could think of a kind of steady state of the share of people in the largest community over the total population size with a value close to 85%. Hence, this graph is also helpful to answer the third reasearch question.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have hypothesisized above, we expected such increase in the concentration to be driven by a higher likelihood of surviving of individuals from a large community respect to the others as a result of allocating the resources better. The initial largest communities are going to be the ones that absorve the highest share of available food in each period, allowing them to reproduce, and forcing other community individuals to die. Thus, individuals from other communities are going to be more likely to die die after some periods while individuals from the largest community will reproduce as much as they can, given the fixed output that we have set. We have provided two correlation graphs with the intention of proving such intuition. 'Graph 2' shows the correlation between population size in p=10 and the initial community endowment. As we can see in it, although it is not very high, there is a positive correlation. It means that societies with a higher initial concentration of indiviaduals in one community have higher chances to survive in the short run (p=10) and thus, to have a higher population size. 'Graph 3' shows the correlation between population size in the last period (p=40) and the initial endowment as well. As we can see, the correlation is slightly negative. It means that in the long run, societis which were less concentrated in the initial endowment experience a higher population size. This result was surprising to us because we were expecting a slightly positive or a null effect of initial concentration in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, from 'Graph 4' we can see that population size starts with a significant decrease, which could be explained by the rapid mortality of lower ability individuals, by the rapid mortality of individuals who are alone in their community, or by both simultaneously. After such decrease, population size starts to experiment a period of rapid growth which could be explained by a high reproduction rate of higher ability individuals, by a higher reproduction rate of individuals inside a larger community, or by both at the same time. In the last periods we can see that population starts to decrease its growth and achieve a certain equilibrium with a growth rate close to 0. In other words, it reaches a sort of steady state of population size.\n"

    "In our simulation we are not going to use any existing model nor theory. Instead, we are going to design a dynamic 'game' which's rules are going to be set in order to address the research questions formulated above. Hence, we are not trying to solve any optimization problem nor seeking to calculate an equilibrium. However, we have left as a research question whether the simulations lead to steady state (an equilibrium) or to different results depending on the initial endowment. The rules of the simulation game are the following:\n",
    "1.\tThe simulation starts with 'n' number of individuals. Each individual 'i' is going to be randomly allocated to a community 'c’ and is going to have a level of ability to find food 'a'. The range of 'c' communities goes from 0 to infinite and the ability to find food 'a' is going to determine how many pieces of food can an individual find in each period at most with a minimum of ability 'min_a' value of 1 and a maximum 'max_a' of 3.\n",
    "2.\tIn each period 'p', each individual finds 'f' pieces of food (which can go from 0 to 'a'). However, the available amount of food in each period is going to be ‘max_f’, which is going to be set arbitrarily by us.\n",
    "3.\tWe are going to simulate ‘p’ periods of time.\n",
    "4.\tEach individual 'i' starts with a random amount of savings between 'min_s' and 'max_s'. The variable savings stands for the number of pieces of food 'f' that an individual was able to save for the next period. Therefore, savings in each period are going to be equal to the savings accumulated for the previous period (p-1), plus 'f' pieces of food found in the previous period (p-1), minus 1 piece of food which was needed to be consumed in order to survive to the next period (in p-1). Consequently, in each period, each individual has a number of pieces of food equal to the savings achieved for the period plus the found pieces of food in the current period.\n",
    "5.\tIn the case that in a community there is an individual (or some individuals) with more than 1 piece of food, the exceed can be redistributed to individuals without any pieces of food. Therefore, the number of pieces of food in each period is going to be equal to the savings for the current period, plus, the pieces of food found in the current period, plus, one piece of food coming from another member of the community (in case that anyone has savings+found food>1, and another one has savings+found food=0)\n",
    "6.\tIndividuals with 0 pieces of food die in a period 'p' are not going to be able to consume the necessary unit of food to survive to the next period and, consequently, is going to die.\n",
    "7.\tEach individual has a probability 'l' of leaving its community in each period of time.\n",
    "8.\tEach individual has a probability 'r' of reproducing, creating a new individual with the same characteristics of its progenitor. However, once the individual is born, it's going to act independently from its progenitor."

    "In the sensitivity analysis we have increased and decreased each variable by the same range. We have delete all the information (graphs) that did't bring relevant information for the analysis. Contrarily, we have kept relevant graphs to provide new explanaitions to the previous analysis. \n",
    "The first significant change of the sensitivity analysis emerged by increasing time periods by 20 (i.e. p=60). Once we have add them, we have seen that the steady state of population size remains equal during the extention. 'Graph 5' shows such intuition.\n",
    "In the second sensitivity analisis we have changed the initial number of individuals from n=5 to n=2 and n=8. 'Graph 6' and  show that societies with a lower initial amount of individuals tend to concentrate in a single community very fast and very high (close to 90%), but then start to decrease forever. On the other hand, societies starting with a higher amount of individuals tend to concentrate more slowly , but end up with concentration values close to the 80%. 'Graph 7' shows that smaller initial societies lead to a lower population steady state in comparison to what is shown in 'graph 9', where larger initial societies lead to a higher population steady state.\n",
    "The next sensitivity was undertaken by changing the range of minimum ability ('min_a') and maximum ability ('max_a') of the individuals in the society. In 'Graph 10' we can see that individuals tend to concenterate very rapidly to a 90% of concentration. It happens because the as ability is very low in the whole society, the only way to survive is by being part of a society. Contrarily, in 'Graph 13' we can see that societies with high ability among individuals tend to concentrate slowlier, and to a lower concentration level, as they can survive even if they are not part of a large community. ..................................anava per aquiiiiiiii.....................................................\n",

    "One of the main weaknesses of our approach is that the steady state we have found in population size is absolutely dependent on total output, which, in our case, is exogenoulsy given and constant through time. It would be very interesting to run the same simulation but defining a production function with dynamic endogenous inputs instead of an exogenous fixed amount. Running such simulation would enable to analyze better the effects of collectivism and individualism in an economy.\n",
    "Another important weakness to take under consideration is that we didn't analyze which is the role of ability in determining the chances of success of a community, and on the steady state of the population size.\n",
    "It would also be very interesting to define utility functions for the willingness to leave and/or join communities. This way, individuals would choose to leave their community to act on their own, or to join another one with higher chances of succes, leading to an optimal level of individualism and collectivism for a certain level of ability of the individuals."
